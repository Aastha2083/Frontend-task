Responsive Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is designed to adapt smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring a clean and usable layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Hover Animations
Smooth hover effects are applied to buttons, menu links, and cards, including color transitions, underline animations, scaling, and lift effects to enhance user interaction.

Card-Based Layout
The content is displayed using a responsive card-based layout built with CSS Grid. Cards automatically adjust their size and alignment based on the screen width.

Hero Section with Responsive Images
The hero section includes gradient text and responsive images that scale proportionally and maintain visual balance across all devices.

Mobile-Friendly Bottom Navigation
A bottom navigation bar is implemented for smaller screens to improve accessibility and provide an optimized mobile user experience.

CSS Grid and Flexbox
CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to create flexible and structured layouts that adapt naturally to different screen sizes.

Relative Units (rem, %, vw)
Relative units are used instead of fixed pixels to ensure consistent scaling of fonts, spacing, and layout across devices.

Fluid Typography Using clamp()
The clamp() function is used to create fluid typography and spacing that automatically adjusts between minimum and maximum values based on the viewport size.
